# Compositional analysis with scaled minhash and gather

## Introduction

### MinHash sketch: similarity and containment

A data sketch is a representative proxy for the original data focused on queries
for specific properties.
It can also be viewed as a probabilistic data structure (in contrast to
deterministic data structures),
since it uses hashing techniques to provide statistical guarantees on the
precision of the answer for a query.
This allows a memory/accuracy trade-off:
using more memory leads to more accurate results,
but in memory-constrained situations it still bound results to an expected error rate.

The MinHash sketch [@broder_resemblance_1997] was developed at Altavista in the context of document clustering and deduplication.
It provides an estimate of the Jaccard similarity
(called **resemblance** in the original article)
and the **containment** of two documents,
estimating how much of document $A$ is contained in document $B$.
These estimates depend on two processes:
converting documents to sets ("Shingling"),
and transforming large sets into short signatures,
while preserving similarity ("Min-Hashing").
In the original use case the *$w$-shingling* $\Omega$ of a document $D$ is defined as the set of all
continuous subsequence of $w$ words contained in $D$.
*Min-hashing* is the process of creating $W = \{\,h(x) \mid \forall x \in \Omega\,\}$,
where $h(x)$ is an uniform hash function,
and then either

a) keeping the $n$ smallest elements ($\mathbf{MIN}_n(W)$), or
b) keeping elements that are $0 \mod m$ ($\mathbf{MOD}_m(W)$).

$\mathbf{MIN}_n(W)$ is fixed-sized (length $n$) and supports similarity estimation,
but doesn't support containment.
$\mathbf{MOD}_m(W)$ supports both similarity and containment,
with the drawback of not being fixed-sized anymore,
growing with the complexity of the document.

### mash and genomic minhash

Mash [@ondov_mash:_2016] was the first implementation of MinHash in genomic contexts,
relating the $w$-shingling of a document to the $k$-mer composition of genomic
datasets,
and using the $\mathbf{MIN}_n(W)$ fixed-sized formulation for the signature.
Mash needs extra information (the genome size for the organism being queried) to account for genomic complexity in datasets and derive a new score,
the Mash distance,
to bring it closer to previously existing similarity measures in biology
(Average Nucleotide Identity).
This extra information is required because using a fixed-size MinHash leads to
different degrees of accuracy when comparing across highly-diverged organisms
(bacteria to animals, for example),
and it is even more extreme when taking more complex datasets into account (like metagenomes).

## Scaled MinHash

In order to calculate containment

$\mathbf{MIN}_n(W)$ fixed-sized formulation

### Comparison with mod hash

MinHash containment: mash works only on datasets of similar genome size/complexity
ModHash is a solution (more complex dataset will have larger sketch), but falls apart
with very small dataset (might not contain enough hashes for meaningful results)

(intro CMash here)

## Decomposition of queries with gather

<!--
CTB suggestion: put gather in {\tt form} or {\sf form} to distinguish it.

### Limitations

- increased size (compared with minhash, which is constant size)
- detection threshold (viruses)

## Implementation

### smol

`smol` is a minimal implementation for the Scaled MinHash sketch and the gather method for simulation and verifying results with more featureful tools.
There are two compatible versions,
one in Python and another in Rust,
due to performance requirements when processing large datasets (like metagenomes).
Both versions of the Scaled MinHash implementations use each language standard library sets
(`set` for Python, `HashSet` for Rust)
for storing hashes and efficient set operations (intersection and difference).
Experiments used the Rust version for calculating Scaled MinHash sketches,
and the Python version for running gather and reporting containment scores.
Since they serialize the sketches to a compatible JSON format,
they can be used interchangeably and while computing Scaled MinHash sketches is
orders of magnitude faster in Rust,
for gather running time are similar and in the order of seconds.

The Python version has two external dependencies:
`screed` for sequence parsing,
and `mmh3` for the MurmurHash3 hash function.
Other modules from the standard library are used for JSON serialization (`json`)
and command line parsing (`argparse`).

The Rust version has four direct external dependencies:
`needletail` for sequence parsing and normalization
(similar to what `screed` does in the Python version),
`murmurhash3` for the MurmurHash3 hash function,
`serde_json` for JSON serialization and `structopt` for command line parsing.

### exact

`exact` is an exact k-mer counting implementation in Rust.
It also uses the standard library `HashSet` to store the $k$-mer composition of
a dataset,
and Needletail for sequence parsing.
It differs from `smol` because it stores all canonical $k$-mers,
instead of a subset.
The `bincode` library is used for serialization,
since it provides a simpler binary format output for Rust data types.
The goal is not to have a general purpose tool,
but only a way to calculate the ground truth for containment in a dataset,
and so a more compatible serialization format
(like JSON in the `smol` case)
is not required.

## Evaluation

### Average Scaled MinHash sketch sizes across Genbank domains

<!--
Use genbank signatures
-->

### Containment score methods

<!--
- containment score experiments

CTBQ: Write up these results.
-->



(show method works, even if slow -> leading to introduction of other indices)

(use scaled=1 and scaled=1000, show results are similar.
Use small datasets, since scaled=1 will be huge...)

(maybe use podar dataset?)

(compare with cmash/mash screen here?)

(cmash and mash screen can do `gather` too,
but still require the original data available.
Scaled MinHash allows using the sketches for gather,
which are a fraction of the original data in size.
Additional benefit:
if there are collection updates you don't need to recalculate the query sketch,
and both cmash and mash screen would need the original data for the query
again)

### Implementation for experiments

Experiments are implemented in `snakemake` workflows and use `conda` for
managing dependencies,
allowing reproducibility of the results with one command:
`snakemake --use-conda`.
This will download all data,
install dependencies and generate the data used for analysis.

The analysis is contained in a Jupyter Notebook,
and can be executed in any place where it is supported,
including in a local installation or using Binder,
a service that deploy a live Jupyter environment in cloud instances.
