	title = {Directions to use probabilistic algorithms for cardinality for {DNA} analysis},
	abstract = {Probabilistic algorithms for cardinality (see for example [1]) allow to estimate the number of distinct words of very large multisets. Best of them are very fast (only few tens of {CPU} operations per element) c and use constant memory (standard error of √M attained using M units of memory) to be compared with the linear memory used by exact algorithms. Hence they allow to do multiple experiments in few minutes with few {KiloBytes} on files of several {GigaBytes} that would be unfeasible with exact counting algorithms. Typically they are used for applications in the area of databases (see [2]) or networking (see [3] or [4]). Such algorithms are used here to analyze base correlation in human genome. The correlation is measured by the number of distinct subwords of fixed size k (10 bases for example) in a {DNA} piece of size N. The idea is that a sequence with few distinct subwords is more corrolated than a sequence of same size with more distinct subwords. Three different angles of study are introduced:- Are all possible words (4 k subwords of size k) present in the genome or, on the contrary, are a lot of patterns forbidden?- Is the genome homogeneus or are some areas more corrolated than others? In the late case, is it possible to recognize or have location hints, in a fast and easy way, for regions of different natures such as repetitions, coding or not coding regions?- What is the arrival rate of distinct subwords in the genome when considered as a sequence read},

	abstract = {We introduce {GATTACA}, a framework for rapid and accurate binning of metagenomic contigs from a single or multiple metagenomic samples into clusters associated with individual species. The clusters are computed using co-abundance profiles within a set of reference metagnomes; unlike previous methods, {GATTACA} estimates these profiles from k-mer counts stored in a highly compact index. On multiple synthetic and real benchmark datasets, {GATTACA} produces clusters that correspond to distinct bacterial species with an accuracy that matches earlier methods, while being up to 20x faster when the reference panel index can be computed offline and 6x faster for online co-abundance estimation. Leveraging the {MinHash} technique to quickly compare metagenomic samples, {GATTACA} also provides an efficient way to identify publicly-available metagenomic data that can be incorporated into the set of reference metagenomes to further improve binning accuracy. Thus, enabling easy indexing and reuse of publicly-available metagenomic datasets, {GATTACA} makes accurate metagenomic analyses accessible to a much wider range of researchers.},

	abstract = {We consider the problem of approximate set similarity search under Braun-Blanquet similarity \$B({\textbackslash}mathbf\{x\}, {\textbackslash}mathbf\{y\}) = {\textbar}{\textbackslash}mathbf\{x\} {\textbackslash}cap {\textbackslash}mathbf\{y\}{\textbar} / {\textbackslash}max({\textbar}{\textbackslash}mathbf\{x\}{\textbar}, {\textbar}{\textbackslash}mathbf\{y\}{\textbar})\$. The \$(b\_2, b\_2)\$-approximate Braun-Blanquet similarity search problem is to preprocess a collection of sets \$P\$ such that, given a query set \${\textbackslash}mathbf\{q\}\$, if there exists \${\textbackslash}mathbf\{x\} {\textbackslash}in P\$ with \$B({\textbackslash}mathbf\{q\}, {\textbackslash}mathbf\{x\}) {\textbackslash}geq b\_1\$, then we can efficiently return \${\textbackslash}mathbf\{x\}' {\textbackslash}in P\$ with \$B({\textbackslash}mathbf\{q\}, {\textbackslash}mathbf\{x\}') {\textgreater} b\_2\$. We present a simple data structure that solves this problem with space usage \$O(n{\textasciicircum}\{1+{\textbackslash}rho\}{\textbackslash}log n + {\textbackslash}sum\_\{{\textbackslash}mathbf\{x\} {\textbackslash}in P\}{\textbar}{\textbackslash}mathbf\{x\}{\textbar})\$ and query time \$O({\textbar}{\textbackslash}mathbf\{q\}{\textbar}n{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}rho\} {\textbackslash}log n)\$ where \$n = {\textbar}P{\textbar}\$ and \${\textbackslash}rho = {\textbackslash}log(1/b\_1)/{\textbackslash}log(1/b\_2)\$. Making use of existing lower bounds for locality-sensitive hashing by O'Donnell et al. ({TOCT} 2014) we show that this value of \${\textbackslash}rho\$ is tight across the parameter space, i.e., for every choice of constants \$0 {\textless} b\_2 {\textless} b\_1 {\textless} 1\$. In the case where all sets have the same size our solution strictly improves upon the value of \${\textbackslash}rho\$ that can be obtained through the use of state-of-the-art data-independent techniques in the Indyk-Motwani locality-sensitive hashing framework ({STOC} 1998) such as Broder's {MinHash} ({CCS} 1997) for Jaccard similarity and Andoni et al.'s cross-polytope {LSH} ({NIPS} 2015) for cosine similarity. Surprisingly, even though our solution is data-independent, for a large part of the parameter space we outperform the currently best data-dependent method by Andoni and Razenshteyn ({STOC} 2015).},

	shorttitle = {{HyperMinHash}},
	abstract = {In this extended abstract, we describe and analyse a streaming probabilistic sketch, {HYPERMINHASH}, to estimate the Jaccard index (or Jaccard similarity coefficient) over two sets \$A\$ and \$B\$. {HyperMinHash} can be thought of as a compression of standard {MinHash} by building off of a {HyperLogLog} count-distinct sketch. Given Jaccard index \${\textbackslash}delta\$, using \$k\$ buckets of size \$O({\textbackslash}log(l) + {\textbackslash}log{\textbackslash}log({\textbar}A {\textbackslash}cup B{\textbar}))\$ (in practice, typically 2 bytes) per set, {HyperMinHash} streams over \$A\$ and \$B\$ and generates an estimate of the Jaccard index \${\textbackslash}delta\$ with error \$O(1/l + {\textbackslash}sqrt\{k/{\textbackslash}delta\})\$. This improves on the best previously known sketch, {MinHash}, which requires the same number of storage units (buckets), but using \$O({\textbackslash}log({\textbar}A {\textbackslash}cup B{\textbar}))\$ bit per bucket. For instance, our new algorithm allows estimating Jaccard indices of 0.01 for set cardinalities on the order of \$10{\textasciicircum}\{19\}\$ with relative error of around 5{\textbackslash}\% using 64KiB of memory; the previous state-of-the-art {MinHash} can only estimate Jaccard indices for cardinalities of \$10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}\$ with the same memory consumption. Alternately, one can think of {HyperMinHash} as an augmentation of b-bit {MinHash} that enables streaming updates, unions, and cardinality estimation (and thus intersection cardinality by way of Jaccard), while using \${\textbackslash}log{\textbackslash}log\$ extra bits.},

Conflict-free Replicated Data Types ({CRDTs}) allow the design of predictable multi-master replication and support eventual consistency of replicas that are allowed to transiently diverge. {CRDTs} come in two flavors: state-based, where a state is changed locally and shipped and merged into other replicas; operation-based, where operations are issued locally and reliably causal broadcast to all other replicas. However, the standard definition of op-based {CRDTs} is very encompassing, allowing even sending the full-state, and thus imposing storage and dissemination overheads as well as blurring the distinction from state-based {CRDTs}. We introduce pure op-based {CRDTs}, that can only send operations to other replicas, drawing a clear distinction from state-based ones. Data types with commutative operations can be trivially implemented as pure op-based {CRDTs} using standard reliable causal delivery; whereas data types having non-commutative operations are implemented using a {PO}-Log, a partially ordered log of operations, and making use of an extended {API}, i.e., a Tagged Causal Stable Broadcast ({TCSB}), that provides extra causality information upon delivery and later informs when delivered messages become causally stable, allowing further {PO}-Log compaction. The framework is illustrated by a catalog of pure op-based specifications for classic {CRDTs}, including counters, multi-value registers, add-wins and remove-wins sets.},

	abstract = {Bloom filters are probabilistic data structures commonly used for approximate membership problems in many areas of Computer Science (networking, distributed systems, databases, etc.). With the increase in data size and distribution of data, problems arise where a large number of Bloom filters are available, and all them need to be searched for potential matches. As an example, in a federated cloud environment, each cloud provider could encode the information using Bloom filters and share the Bloom filters with a central coordinator. The problem of interest is not only whether a given element is in any of the sets represented by the Bloom filters, but which of the existing sets contain the given element. This problem cannot be solved by just constructing a Bloom filter on the union of all the sets. Instead, we effectively have a multidimensional Bloom filter problem: given an element, we wish to receive a list of candidate sets where the element might be. To solve this problem, we consider 3 alternatives. Firstly, we can naively check many Bloom filters. Secondly, we propose to organize the Bloom filters in a hierarchical index structure akin to a B+ tree, that we call Bloofi. Finally, we propose another data structure that packs the Bloom filters in such a way as to exploit bit-level parallelism, which we call Flat-Bloofi. Our theoretical and experimental results show that Bloofi and Flat-Bloofi provide scalable and efficient solutions alternatives to search through a large number of Bloom filters.},

Furthermore, the exponential increase of these archives is likely to be further spurred by automated diagnostics. To unlock their use for scientific research and real-time surveillance we have combined knowledge about bacterial genetic variation with ideas used in web-search, to build a {DNA} search engine for microbial data that can grow incrementally. We indexed the complete global corpus of bacterial and viral whole genome sequence data (447,833 genomes), using four orders of magnitude less storage than previous methods. The method allows future scaling to millions of genomes. This renders the global archive accessible to sequence search, which we demonstrate with three applications: ultra-fast search for resistance genes {MCR}1-3, analysis of host-range for 2827 plasmids, and quantification of the rise of antibiotic resistance prevalence in the sequence archives.},

We create {VARIMERGE}, for building the colored de Bruijn graph on a very-large dataset through partitioning the data into smaller subsets, building the colored de Bruijn graph using a {FM}-index based representation, and merging these representations in an iterative format. This last step is an algorithmic challenge for which we present an algorithm in this paper. Lastly, we demonstrate the utility of {VARIMERGE} by demonstrating: a four-fold reduction in working space when constructing an 8,000 color dataset, and the construction of population graph two orders of magnitude larger than previous reported methods.},

As our main contribution, we develop methods to perform set operations, which facilitate cardinality estimates under strong privacy requirements. Most notably, we propose an efficient, privacy-preserving algorithm to estimate the set intersection cardinality. P2KMV provides plausible deniability for all data items contained in the sketch.

	abstract = {K-mer profiling has been one of the trending approaches to analyze read data generated by high-throughput sequencing technologies. The tasks of k-mer profiling include, but are not limited to, counting the frequencies and determining the occurrences of short sequences in a dataset. The notion of k-mer has been extensively used to build de Bruijn graphs in genome or transcriptome assembly, which requires examining all possible k-mers presented in the dataset. Recently, an alternative way of profiling has been proposed, which constructs a set of representative k-mers as genomic markers and profiles their occurrences in the sequencing data. This technique has been applied in both transcript quantification through {RNA}-Seq and taxonomic classification of metagenomic reads. Most of these applications use a set of fixed-size k-mers since the majority of existing k-mer counters are inadequate to process genomic sequences with variable-length k-mers. However, choosing the appropriate k is challenging, as it varies for different applications. As a pioneer work to profile a set of variable-length k-mers, we propose {TahcoRoll} in order to enhance the Aho-Corasick algorithm. More specifically, we use one bit to represent each nucleotide, and integrate the rolling hash technique to construct an efficient in-memory data structure for this task. Using both synthetic and real datasets, results show that {TahcoRoll} outperforms existing approaches in either or both time and memory efficiency without using any disk space. In addition, compared to the most efficient state-of-the-art k-mer counters, such as {KMC} and {MSBWT}, {TahcoRoll} is the only approach that can process long read data from both {PacBio} and Oxford Nanopore on a commodity desktop computer. The source code of {TahcoRoll} is implemented in C++14, and available at https://github.com/chelseaju/{TahcoRoll}.git.},

The maximum likelihood approach can also be applied to more than a single {HyperLogLog} sketch. In particular, it is shown that it gives more precise cardinality estimates for union, intersection, or relative complements of two sets that are both represented by {HyperLogLog} sketches compared to the conventional technique using the inclusion-exclusion principle.

Recent advances based on the idea of densification{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}cite\{Proc:{OneHashLSH}\_ICML14,Proc:Shrivastava\_UAI14\} have shown that it is possible to compute \$k\$ minwise hashes, of a vector with \$d\$ nonzeros, in mere \$(d + k)\$ computations, a significant improvement over the classical \$O(dk)\$. These advances have led to an algorithmic improvement in the query complexity of traditional indexing algorithms based on minwise hashing. Unfortunately, the variance of the current densification techniques is unnecessarily high, which leads to significantly poor accuracy compared to vanilla minwise hashing, especially when the data is sparse. In this paper, we provide a novel densification scheme which relies on carefully tailored 2-universal hashes. We show that the proposed scheme is variance-optimal, and without losing the runtime efficiency, it is significantly more accurate than existing densification techniques. As a result, we obtain a significantly efficient hashing scheme which has the same variance and collision probability as minwise hashing. Experimental evaluations on real sparse and high-dimensional datasets validate our claims. We believe that given the significant advantages, our method will replace minwise hashing implementations in practice.},

The assembly of these reads can be difficult and analysis methods based on mapping reads to genes or pathways are also restricted by the availability and completeness of existing databases.

	abstract = {Background
Identification of biological specimens is a requirement for a range of applications. Reference-free methods analyse unprocessed sequencing data without relying on prior knowledge, but generally do not scale to arbitrarily large genomes and arbitrarily large phylogenetic distances.

Results
We present Cnidaria, a practical tool for clustering genomic and transcriptomic data with no limitation on genome size or phylogenetic distances. We successfully simultaneously clustered 169 genomic and transcriptomic datasets from 4 kingdoms, achieving 100 \% identification accuracy at supra-species level and 78 \% accuracy at the species level.

Conclusion
{CNIDARIA} allows for fast, resource-efficient comparison and identification of both raw and assembled genome and transcriptome data. This can help answer both fundamental (e.g. in phylogeny, ecological diversity analysis) and practical questions (e.g. sequencing quality control, primer design).

Despite its public availability, a majority of this data remains hard to query to the research community due to a lack of efficient data representation and indexing solutions. One of the available techniques to represent read data is a condensed form as an assembly graph. Such a representation contains all sequence information but does not store contextual information and metadata. We present two new approaches for a compressed representation of a graph coloring: a lossless compression scheme based on a novel application of wavelet tries as well as a highly accurate lossy compression based on a set of Bloom filters. Both strategies retain a coloring with dynamically changing graph topology. We present construction and merge procedures for both methods and evaluate their performance on a wide range of different datasets. By dropping the requirement of a fully lossless compression and using the topological information of the underlying graph, we can reduce memory requirements by up to three orders of magnitude. Representing individual colors as independently stored modules, our approaches are fully dynamic and can be efficiently parallelized. These properties allow for an easy upscaling to the problem sizes common to the biomedical domain. We provide prototype implementations in C++, summaries of our experiments as well as links to all datasets publicly at https://github.com/ratschlab/graph\_annotation.},

	abstract = {Clustering techniques are widely used in the analysis of large data sets to group together samples with similar properties. For example, clustering is often used in the field of single-cell {RNA}- sequencing in order to identify different cell types present in a tissue sample. There are many algorithms for performing clustering and the results can vary substantially. In particular, the number of groups present in a data set is often unknown and the number of clusters identified by an algorithm can change based on the parameters used. To explore and examine the impact of varying clustering resolution we present clustering trees. This visualisation shows the relationships between clusters at multiple resolutions allowing researchers to see how samples move as the number of clusters increases. In addition, meta-information can be overlaid on the tree to inform the choice of resolution and guide in identification of clusters. We illustrate the features of clustering trees using a series of simulations as well as two real examples, the classical iris dataset and a complex single-cell {RNA}-sequencing dataset. Clustering trees can be produced using the clustree R package available from {CRAN} (https://{CRAN}.R-project.org/package=clustree) and developed on {GitHub} (https://github.com/lazappi/clustree).},

	abstract = {Histogram-based similarity has been widely adopted in many machine learning tasks. However, measuring histogram similarity is a challenging task for streaming data, where the elements of a histogram are observed in a streaming manner. First, the ever-growing cardinality of histogram elements makes any similarity computation inefficient. Second, the concept-drift issue in the data streams also impairs the accurate assessment of the similarity. In this paper, we propose to overcome the above challenges with {HistoSketch}, a fast similarity-preserving sketching method for streaming histograms with concept drift. Specifically, {HistoSketch} is designed to incrementally maintain a set of compact and fixed-size sketches of streaming histograms to approximate similarity between the histograms, with the special consideration of gradually forgetting the outdated histogram elements. We evaluate {HistoSketch} on multiple classification tasks using both synthetic and real-world datasets. The results show that our method is able to efficiently approximate similarity for streaming histograms and quickly adapt to concept drift. Compared to full streaming histograms gradually forgetting the outdated histogram elements, {HistoSketch} is able to dramatically reduce the classification time (with a 7500x speedup) with only a modest loss in accuracy (about 3.5\%).},

	abstract = {Motivation: The growth in publically available microbiome data in recent years has yielded an invaluable resource for genomic research; allowing for the design of new studies, augmentation of novel datasets and reanalysis of published works. This vast amount of microbiome data, as well as the widespread proliferation of microbiome research and the looming era of clinical metagenomics, means there is an urgent need to develop analytics that can process huge amounts of data in a short amount of time. To address this need, we propose a new method for the compact representation of microbiome sequencing data using similarity-preserving sketches of streaming k-mer spectra. These sketches allow for dissimilarity estimation, rapid microbiome catalogue searching, and classification of microbiome samples in near real-time. Results: We apply streaming histogram sketching to microbiome samples as a form of dimensionality reduction, creating a compressed "histosketch" that can be used to efficiently represent microbiome k-mer spectra. Using public microbiome datasets, we show that histosketches can be clustered by sample type using pairwise Jaccard similarity estimation, consequently allowing for rapid microbiome similarity searches via a locality sensitive hashing indexing scheme. Furthermore, we show that histosketches can be used to train machine learning classifiers to accurately label microbiome samples. Specifically, using a collection of 108 novel microbiome samples from a cohort of premature neonates, we trained and tested a Random Forest Classifier that could accurately predict whether the neonate had received antibiotic treatment (95\% accuracy, precision 97\%) and could subsequently be used to classify microbiome data streams in less than 12 seconds. We provide our implementation, Histosketching Using Little K-mers ({HULK}), which can histosketch a typical 2GB microbiome in 50 seconds on a standard laptop using 4 cores, with the sketch occupying 3000 bytes of disk space.

These efforts have led to lower memory highly efficient indexes, but often lack sensitivity in the face of sequencing errors or polymorphism because they are k-mer based. To address this, we designed a new memory efficient data structure that can tolerate mismatches using multiple spaced seeds, called a multi-index Bloom Filter. Implemented as part of {BioBloom} Tools, we demonstrate our algorithm in two applications, read binning for targeted assembly and taxonomic read assignment. Our tool shows a higher sensitivity and specificity for read-binning than {BWA} {MEM} at an order of magnitude less time.

	abstract = {The exponential growth of assembled genome sequences greatly benefits metagenomic studies, providing a broader catalog of reference organisms in a variety of studies. However, due to the massive amount of sequences, tools are struggling to manage such data and their frequent updates. Processing and indexing currently available repositories is no longer possible on standard infrastructures and can take days and hundreds of {GB} even on large servers. Few methods have acknowledged such issues thus far and even though many can theoretically handle large amounts of references, time-memory requirements are prohibitive for a real application. As a result, many tools still rely on static outdated datasets and clearly underperform under the currently available wealth of genome sequences. The content and taxonomic distribution of such databases is also a crucial factor, introducing bias when not properly managed. Motivated by those limitations we created ganon, a k-mer based short read classification tool which uses Interleaved Bloom Filters in conjunction with a taxonomic clustering and a k-mer counting-filtering scheme. Ganon provides an efficient method for indexing references and keeping them updated, requiring under 25 minutes to index the complete (i.e. high quality) archaeal-bacterial genomes and under 3 hours for all archaeal-bacterial genomes (30GB and 380GB of raw data, respectively). Ganon can keep such indices up-to-date in a fraction of the time necessary to create them allowing researchers to permanently work on the most recent references. Using data from the {CAMI} challenge, ganon shows strongly improved precision (in some cases more than double) while having equal or better sensitivity compared to state-of-the-art tools. Ganon's memory footprint is less than half of similar tools using the same reference set. Using a larger set of references with a broader diversity, ganon classified 25\% more reads achieving 97\% precision at species level. Ganon supports taxonomy and assembly level classification as well as multiple indices for a hierarchical classification.

	abstract = {Low-cost clouds can alleviate the compute and storage burden of the genome sequencing data explosion. However, moving personal genome data analysis to the cloud can raise serious privacy concerns. Here, we devise a method named Balaur, a privacy preserving read mapper for hybrid clouds based on locality sensitive hashing and kmer voting. Balaur can securely outsource a substantial fraction of the computation to the public cloud, while being highly competitive in accuracy and speed with non-private state-of-the-art read aligners on short read data. We also show that the method is significantly faster than the state of the art in long read mapping. Therefore, Balaur can enable institutions handling massive genomic data sets to shift part of their analysis to the cloud without sacrificing accuracy or exposing sensitive information to an untrusted third party., Outsourcing computation for genomic data processing offers the ability to allocate massive computing power and storage on demand. Here, Popic and Batzoglou develop a hybrid cloud aligner for sequence read mapping that preserves privacy with competitive accuracy and speed.},

This enables memory-limited execution of several statistical analyses over streams, including online feature selection, streaming data explanation, relative deltoid detection, and streaming estimation of pointwise mutual information. Unlike related sketches that capture the most frequently-occurring features (or items) in a data stream, the Weight-Median Sketch captures the features that are most discriminative of one stream (or class) compared to another. The Weight-Median Sketch adopts the core data structure used in the Count-Sketch, but, instead of sketching counts, it captures sketched gradient updates to the model parameters. We provide a theoretical analysis that establishes recovery guarantees for batch and online learning, and demonstrate empirical improvements in memory-accuracy trade-offs over alternative memory-budgeted methods, including count-based sketches and feature hashing.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Motivation: Sequence alignment is a central operation in bioinformatics pipeline and, despite many improvements, remains a computationally challenging problem. Locality Sensitive Hashing ({LSH}) is one method used to estimate the likelihood of two sequences to have a proper alignment. Using an {LSH}, it is possible to separate, with high probability and relatively low computation, the pairs of sequences that do not have an alignment from those that may have an alignment. Therefore, an {LSH} reduces in the overall computational requirement while not introducing many false negatives (i.e., omitting to report a valid alignment). However, current {LSH} methods treat sequences as a bag of k-mers and do not take into account the relative ordering of k-mers in sequences. And due to the lack of a practical {LSH} method for edit distance, in practice, {LSH} methods for Jaccard similarity or Hamming distance are used as a proxy. Results: We present an {LSH} method, called Order Min Hash ({OMH}), for the edit distance. This method is a refinement of the {minHash} {LSH} used to approximate the Jaccard similarity, in that {OMH} is not only sensitive to the k-mer contents of the sequences but also to the relative order of the k-mers in the sequences. We present theoretical guarantees of the {OMH} as a gapped {LSH}.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

A theoretically motivated extension to the original estimator is presented that eliminates the bias for small and large cardinalities. Based on the maximum likelihood principle a second unbiased method is derived together with a robust and efficient numerical algorithm to calculate the estimate. The maximum likelihood approach can also be applied to more than a single {HyperLogLog} sketch. In particular, it is shown that it gives more precise cardinality estimates for union, intersection, or relative complements of two sets that are both represented by {HyperLogLog} sketches compared to the conventional technique using the inclusion-exclusion principle.

Minimizers are a central recent paradigm that has improved various sequence analysis tasks, including hashing for faster read overlap detection, sparse suffix arrays for creating smaller indexes, and Bloom filters for speeding up sequence search. Here, we propose an alternative paradigm that can lead to substantial further improvement in these and other tasks. For integers k and L {\textgreater} k, we say that a set of k-mers is a universal hitting set ({UHS}) if every possible L-long sequence must contain a k-mer from the set. We develop a heuristic called {DOCKS} to find a compact {UHS}, which works in two phases: The first phase is solved optimally, and for the second we propose several efficient heuristics, trading set size for speed and memory. The use of heuristics is motivated by showing the {NP}-hardness of a closely related problem. We show that {DOCKS} works well in practice and produces {UHSs} that are very close to a theoretical lower bound. We present results for various values of k and L and by applying them to real genomes show that {UHSs} indeed improve over minimizers. In particular, {DOCKS} uses less than 30\% of the 10-mers needed to span the human genome compared to minimizers. The software and computed {UHSs} are freely available at github.com/Shamir-Lab/{DOCKS}/ and acgt.cs.tau.ac.il/docks/, respectively.},

	abstract = {The analysis of biological sequencing data has been one of the biggest applications of string algorithms. The approaches used in many such applications are based on the analysis of kmers, which are short ﬁxed-length strings present in a dataset. While these approaches are rather diverse, storing and querying k-mer sets has emerged as a shared underlying component. Sets of k-mers have unique features and applications that, over the last ten years, have resulted in many specialized approaches for their representation. In this survey, we give a uniﬁed presentation and comparison of the data structures that have been proposed to store and query k-mer sets. We hope this survey will not only serve as a resource for researchers in the ﬁeld but also make the area more accessible to outsiders.},

	abstract = {We present a new solution for finding joinable tables in massive data lakes: given a table and one join column, find tables that can be joined with the given table on the largest number of distinct values. The problem can be formulated as an overlap set similarity search problem by considering columns as sets and matching values as intersection between sets. Although set similarity search is well-studied in the field of approximate string search (e.g., fuzzy keyword search), the solutions are designed for and evaluated over sets of relatively small size (average set size rarely much over 100 and maximum set size in the low thousands) with modest dictionary sizes (the total number of distinct values in all sets is only a few million). We observe that modern data lakes typically have massive set sizes (with maximum set sizes that may be tens of millions) and dictionaries that include hundreds of millions of distinct values. Our new algorithm, {JOSIE} ({JOining} Search using Intersection Estimation) minimizes the cost of set reads and inverted index probes used in finding the top-k sets. We show that {JOSIE} completely out performs the state-of-the-art overlap set similarity search techniques on data lakes. More surprising, we also consider state-of-the-art approximate algorithm and show that our new exact search algorithm performs almost as well, and even in some cases better, on real data lakes.},

In 2017, there were as many as 10,000 new organisms sequenced and added into the {RefSeq} Database. Taxonomy prediction is a science involving the hierarchical classification of {DNA} fragments up to the rank species. In this research, we introduce Predicting Linked Organisms, Plinko, for short. Plinko is a fully-functioning, state-of-the-art predictive system that accurately captures {DNA} - Taxonomy relationships where other state-of-the-art algorithms falter. Plinko leverages multi-view convolutional neural networks and the pre-defined taxonomy tree structure to improve multi-level taxonomy prediction. In the Plinko strategy, each network takes advantage of different word usage patterns corresponding to different levels of evolutionary divergence. Plinko has the advantages of relatively low storage, {GPGPU} parallel training and inference, making the solution portable, and scalable with anticipated genome database growth. To the best of our knowledge, Plinko is the first to use multi-view convolutional neural networks as the core algorithm in a compositional,alignment-free approach to taxonomy prediction.},

Query results may contain a number of false positives which decreases exponentially with the query length and the false positive rate of the index determined at construction time. We compare {COBS} to seven other index software packages on 100 000 microbial {DNA} samples. {COBS}’ compact but simple data structure outperforms the other indexes in construction time and query performance with Mantis by Pandey et al. on second place. However, diﬀerent from Mantis and other previous work, {COBS} does not need the complete index in {RAM} and is thus designed to scale to larger document sets.},

The {BLAST} nt database, based on the traditional divisions of {GenBank}, has been the default and most comprehensive database for nucleotide {BLAST} searches and for taxonomic classification software in metagenomics. Here we argue that this is no longer the case. Currently, the {NCBI} {WGS} database contains one billion reads (almost five times more than {GenBank}), and with 4.4 trillion nucleotides, {WGS} has about 14 times more nucleotides than {GenBank}. This ratio is growing with time. We advocate a change in the database paradigm in taxonomic classification by systematically combining the nt and {WGS} databases in order to boost taxonomic classifiers sensitivity. We present here a case in which, by adding {WGS} data, we obtained over five times more classified reads and with a higher confidence score. To facilitate the adoption of this approach, we provide the {draftGenomes} script.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Author summary{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Culture-independent methods are revolutionizing biology.

The {BLAST} nt database has become a de facto standard for taxonomic classifiers in metagenomics. We believe that it is time for a change in the database paradigm for such a classification. We advocate the systematic combination of the {BLAST} nt database with genomes of the massive {NCBI} Whole-Genome Shotgun ({WGS}) database. We make {draftGenomes} available, a script that eases the adoption of this approach. Current developments and technologies make it feasible now. Our recent results in several metagenomic projects indicate that this strategy boosts the sensitivity in taxonomic classifications.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Current methods for comparing microbial communities face important limitations. Those based on taxonomical or functional assignation rely on a small subset of the sequences that can be associated to known organisms. On the other hand, de novo methods, that compare the whole sets of sequences, either do not scale up on ambitious metagenomic projects or do not provide precise and exhaustive results. Methods These limitations motivated the development of a new de novo metagenomic comparative method, called Simka. This method computes a large collection of standard ecological distances by replacing species counts by k-mer counts. Simka scales-up today’s metagenomic projects thanks to a new parallel k-mer counting strategy on multiple datasets. Results Experiments on public Human Microbiome Project datasets demonstrate that Simka captures the essential underlying biological structure. Simka was able to compute in a few hours both qualitative and quantitative ecological distances on hundreds of metagenomic samples (690 samples, 32 billions of reads). We also demonstrate that analyzing metagenomes at the k-mer level is highly correlated with extremely precise de novo comparison techniques which rely on all-versus-all sequences alignment strategy or which are based on taxonomic profiling.},

Extensive new algorithms have been developed and successfully applied to different applications. However, two critical problems are rarely mentioned. First, in real-world applications, the data often comes in a streaming fashion but most of existing hashing methods are batch based models. Second, when the dataset becomes huge, it is almost impossible to load all the data into memory to train hashing models. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to handle these two problems simultaneously based on the idea of data sketching. A sketch of one dataset preserves its major characters but with signiﬁcantly smaller size. With a small size sketch, our method can learn hash functions in an online fashion, while needs rather low computational complexity and storage space. Extensive experiments on two large scale benchmarks and one synthetic dataset demonstrate the efﬁcacy of the proposed method.},

In this paper, we introduce an effective method, i.e. the min-max hash method, which significantly reduces the hashing time by half, yet it has a provably slightly smaller variance in estimating pair wise Jaccard similarity. In addition, the estimator of min-max hash only contains pair wise equality checking, thus it is especially suitable for approximate nearest neighbor search. Since min-max hash is equally simple as min-wise hash, many extensions based on min-wise hash can be easily adapted to min-max hash, and we show how to combine it with b-bit minwise hash. Experiments show that with the same length of hash code, min-max hash reduces the hashing time to half as much as that of min-wise hash, while achieving smaller mean squared error ({MSE}) in estimating pair wise Jaccard similarity, and better best approximate ratio ({BAR}) in approximate nearest neighbor search.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Whole-genome shotgun sequencing enables the analysis of microbial communities in unprecedented detail, with major implications in medicine and ecology. Predicting the presence and relative abundances of microbes in a sample, known as "metagenomic profiling", is a critical first step in microbiome analysis. Existing profiling methods have been shown to suffer from poor false positive or false negative rates, while alignment-based approaches are often considered accurate but computationally infeasible. Here we present a novel method, Metalign, that addresses these concerns by performing efficient alignment-based metagenomic profiling. We use a containment min hash approach to reduce the reference database size dramatically before alignment and a method to estimate organism relative abundances in the sample by resolving reads aligned to multiple genomes. We show that Metalign achieves significantly improved results over existing methods on simulated datasets from a large benchmarking study, {CAMI}, and performs well on in vitro mock community data and environmental data from the Tara Oceans project.

The Critical Assessment of Metagenome Interpretation ({CAMI}) challenge has engaged the global developer community to benchmark their programs on highly complex and realistic data sets, generated from ∼700 newly sequenced microorganisms and ∼600 novel viruses and plasmids and representing common experimental setups. Assembly and genome binning programs performed well for species represented by individual genomes but were substantially affected by the presence of related strains. Taxonomic profiling and binning programs were proficient at high taxonomic ranks, with a notable performance decrease below family level. Parameter settings markedly affected performance, underscoring their importance for program reproducibility.

	abstract = {Stochastic models of biochemical interactions elucidate essential properties of the network which are not accessible to deterministic modeling. In this thesis it is described how a network motif, the proportional-reversibility interaction with active intermediate states, gives rise to the ability for the variance of biochemical signals to be controlled without changing the mean, a property designated as mean-independent noise control ({MINC}). This noise control is demonstrated to be essential for macro-scale biological processes via spatial models of the zebrafish hindbrain boundary sharpening. Additionally, the ability to deduce noise origin from the aggregate noise properties is shown. However, these large-scale stochastic models of developmental processes required significant advances in the methodology and tooling for solving stochastic differential equations. Two improvements to stochastic integration methods, an efficient method for time stepping adaptivity on high order stochastic Runge-Kutta methods termed Rejection Sampling with Memory ({RSwM}) and optimal-stability stochastic Runge-Kutta methods, are combined to give over 1000 times speedups on biological models over previously used methodologies. In addition, a new software for solving differential equations in the Julia programming language is detailed. Its unique features for handling complex biological models, along with its high performance (routinely benchmarking as faster than classic C++ and Fortran integrators of similar implementations) and new methods, give rise to an accessible tool for simulation of large-scale stochastic biological models.},

The analysis provided here shows a deep connections with special mathematical functions and with extreme value theory. The latter connection may help in explaining heuristic considerations, while the first opens many numerical issues, faced at the end of the present paper.

Speciﬁcally, given a sample consisting of independent draws from any distribution over at most n distinct elements, these properties can be estimated accurately using a sample of size O(n/ log n). We propose a novel modiﬁcation of this approach and show: 1) theoretically, this estimator is optimal (to constant factors, over worst-case instances), and 2) in practice, it performs exceptionally well for a variety of estimation tasks, on a variety of natural distributions, for a wide range of parameters. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the key step in our approach is to ﬁrst use the sample to characterize the “unseen” portion of the distribution. This goes beyond such tools as the Good-Turing frequency estimation scheme, which estimates the total probability mass of the unobserved portion of the distribution: we seek to estimate the shape of the unobserved portion of the distribution. This approach is robust, general, and theoretically principled; we expect that it may be fruitfully used as a component within larger machine learning and data analysis systems.},

	abstract = {Two decades ago, a breakthrough in indexing string collections made it possible to represent them within their compressed space while at the same time offering indexed search functionalities. As this new technology permeated through applications like bioinformatics, the string collections experienced a growth that outperforms Moore's Law and challenges our ability of handling them even in compressed form. It turns out, fortunately, that many of these rapidly growing string collections are highly repetitive, so that their information content is orders of magnitude lower than their plain size. The statistical compression methods used for classical collections, however, are blind to this repetitiveness, and therefore a new set of techniques has been developed in order to properly exploit it. The resulting indexes form a new generation of data structures able to handle the huge repetitive string collections that we are facing. In this survey we cover the algorithmic developments that have led to these data structures. We describe the distinct compression paradigms that have been used to exploit repetitiveness, the fundamental algorithmic ideas that form the base of all the existing indexes, and the various structures that have been proposed, comparing them both in theoretical and practical aspects. We conclude with the current challenges in this fascinating field.},

	abstract = {Salinity is one of the main environmental factors limiting niche boundaries of aquatic species and evolutionary divergence across osmotic niches contributes to generating phyletic diversity within the fishes. While most clades of fish are limited to only one salinity, some groups, such as killifish in the genus Fundulus, have repeatedly diverged from marine to fresh water. Within the euryhaline species F. heteroclitus, genetically distinct, locally adapted populations inhabit salinities ranging from marine to fresh waters, perhaps representing the early stages of speciation across an osmotic boundary. This dissertation seeks to understand the mechanisms enabling evolutionary transitions between osmotic niches in order to illuminate the processes that contribute to adaptive divergence across important ecological boundaries. For F. heteroclitus populations native to both fresh and saline niches, I have integrated and quantified the physiological, transcriptomic, and genomic mechanisms underlying multiple physiological phenotypes to identify the mechanisms contributing to their evolutionary divergence. In chapter 1, I quantify shifts in physiological plasticity of a derived freshwater phenotype and the fate of an ancestral euryhaline phenotype after invasion of a freshwater environment. I use transcriptomic and physiological approaches to identify the mechanistic basis of these shifts. I compared physiological and transcriptomic responses to high and low salinity stress in fresh ({FW}-native) and brackish water ({BW}-native) populations and found an enhanced plasticity to low salinity in the freshwater population coupled with a reduced ability to acclimate to high salinity. Transcriptomic data identified genes with a conserved common response, a conserved salinity dependent response, and responses associated with population divergence. Conserved common acclimation responses revealed stress responses and alterations in cell-cycle regulation as important mechanisms in the general osmotic response. Salinity-specific responses included the regulation of genes involved in ion transport, intracellular calcium, energetic processes, and cellular remodeling. Genes diverged between populations were primarily those showing salinity-specific expression and included those regulating polyamine homeostasis and cell cycle. Additionally, when populations were matched with their native salinity, expression patterns were consistent with the concept of "transcriptomic resilience," suggesting local adaptation. These findings provide insight into the fate of a plastic phenotype after a shift in environmental salinity and help to reveal mechanisms allowing for euryhalinity. Chapter 2 addresses divergence in whole organism osmotic performance. Regulation of internal ion homeostasis is essential for fishes inhabiting environments where salinities differ from their internal concentrations. It is hypothesized that selection will act to reduce energetic costs of osmoregulation in a population's native osmotic habitat, producing patterns of local adaptation. I investigated evidence for local adaptation between the {FW}-native and {BW}-native populations. Aerobic scope (the difference between minimum and maximum metabolic rates), excess post-exercise oxygen consumption, and swimming performance (time and distance to reach exhaustion) were used as proxies for fitness in fresh and brackish water treatments. Swimming performance results supported local adaptation; {BW}-native fish performed significantly better than {FW}-native fish at high salinity while low salinity performance was similar between populations. However, results from metabolic measures did not support this conclusion; both populations showed an increase in resting metabolic rate and a decrease of aerobic scope in fresh water. Similarly, excess post-exercise oxygen consumption was higher for both populations in fresh than in brackish water. While swimming results suggest environmentally dependent performance differences may be a result of selection in divergent osmotic environments, the differences between populations are not coupled with divergence in metabolic performance. The final chapter focuses on identifying the genetic basis of adaptive traits. Detecting loci underlying adaptive phenotypes is a major challenge in evolutionary biology. Typical approaches include genome scans for selection, though these can be difficult to interpret because of incomplete knowledge of the connection between genotype and phenotype. Genome wide association mapping studies are powerful for linking genotype to phenotype, but offer no insight into the evolutionary forces (e.g., natural selection) shaping variation in those genotypes and phenotypes. I attempt to overcome these challenges by merging genome scans for selection and genome wide association studies ({GWAS}). By combining these approaches, I identify loci that are under divergent selection and directly involved in phenotypes that diverge between {FW} and {BW} populations of F. heteroclitus. I focused on the {FW}-native and {BW}-native populations as well as a population that is a natural admixture of those two parental populations. All individuals were phenotyped for multiple physiological traits that differ between populations, and that may contribute to adaptation across osmotic niches: salinity tolerance, hypoxia tolerance, and metabolic rate. All individuals were also genotyped using {RADseq}. I performed selection scans between {BW}-native and {FW}-native populations to identify genomic regions under selection. {GWAS} was conducted in all individuals, including all admixed individuals, to identify loci underlying specific phenotypes. Populations diverge in their physiological capabilities in patterns consistent with local adaptation. Selection is disproportionately targeting loci that influence metabolic rate and salinity tolerance, suggesting that these phenotypes are undergoing adaptive divergence and implicating candidate genes likely involved in physiological capabilities. However, loci associated with hypoxia tolerance do not appear to be evolving by natural selection across osmotic niches. This approach provides a framework to leverage diverse approaches to identify signals of local adaptation in natural populations., Advisor: Andrew Whitehead., Degree granted in Ecology., Ph. D.

It is popular today among advocates of blockchain technology. While frequently employed as if it were a technical term, decentralization more reliably appears to operate as a rhetorical strategy that directs attention toward some aspects of a proposed social order and away from others. It is called for far more than it is theorized or consistently defined. This non-specificity has served to draw diverse participants into common political and technological projects. Yet even the most apparently decentralized systems have shown the capacity to produce economically and structurally centralized outcomes. The rhetoric of decentralization thus obscures other aspects of the re-ordering it claims to describe. It steers attention from where concentrations of power are operating, deferring worthwhile debate about how such power should operate. For decentralization to be a reliable concept in formulating future social arrangements and related technologies, it should come with high standards of specificity. It also cannot substitute for anticipating centralization with appropriate mechanisms of accountability.},

Data location can be easily implemented on top of Chord by associating a key with each data item, and storing the key/data item pair at the node to which the key maps. Chord adapts efficiently as nodes join and leave the system, and can answer queries even if the system is continuously changing. Results from theoretical analysis, simulations, and experiments show that Chord is scalable, with communication cost and the state maintained by each node scaling logarithmically with the number of Chord nodes.},

	abstract = {Big data workflows often require the assembly and exchange of complex, multi-element datasets. For example, in biomedical applications, the input to an analytic pipeline can be a dataset consisting thousands of images and genome sequences assembled from diverse repositories, requiring a description of the contents of the dataset in a concise and unambiguous form. Typical approaches to creating datasets for big data workflows assume that all data reside in a single location, requiring costly data marshaling and permitting errors of omission and commission because dataset members are not explicitly specified. We address these issues by proposing simple methods and tools for assembling, sharing, and analyzing large and complex datasets that scientists can easily integrate into their daily workflows. These tools combine a simple and robust method for describing data collections ({BDBags}), data descriptions (Research Objects), and simple persistent identifiers (Minids) to create a powerful ecosystem of tools and services for big data analysis and sharing. We present these tools and use biomedical case studies to illustrate their use for the rapid assembly, sharing, and analysis of large datasets.},

We demonstrate that this method performs best when the sets under consideration are of similar size and the performance degrades considerably when the sets are of very different size. We introduce a new and efficient approach, called the containment {MinHash} approach, that is more suitable for estimating the Jaccard index of sets of very different size. We accomplish this by leveraging another probabilistic method (in particular, Bloom filters) for fast membership queries. We derive bounds on the probability of estimate errors for the containment {MinHash} approach and show it significantly improves upon the classical {MinHash} approach. We also show significant improvements in terms of time and space complexity. As an application, we use this method to detect the presence/absence of organisms in a metagenomic data set, showing that it can detect the presence of very small, low abundance microorganisms.},

Without encouraging more sustainable development of the potential applications of Blockchain technologies which can have significant social and economic benefits, their resource-intensive design combined now pose a serious threat to the global commitment to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. The article examines government intervention choices to desocialise negative environmental externalities caused by high-energy consuming Blockchain technology designs. The research question explores how to promote the environmentally sustainable development of applications of Blockchain without damaging this valuable sector. It studies existing regulatory and fiscal policy approaches towards digital currencies in order to provide a basis for further legal and policy tools targeted at mitigating energy consumption of Blockchain technologies.

We provide a meta-analysis of the literature, including an overview of approaches to pruning and consistent ﬁndings in the literature. After aggregating results across 81 papers and pruning hundreds of models in controlled conditions, our clearest ﬁnding is that the community suffers from a lack of standardized benchmarks and metrics. This deﬁciency is substantial enough that it is hard to compare pruning techniques to one another or determine how much progress the ﬁeld has made over the past three decades. To address this situation, we identify issues with current practices, suggest concrete remedies, and introduce {ShrinkBench}, an open-source framework to facilitate standardized evaluations of pruning methods. We use {ShrinkBench} to compare various pruning techniques and show that its comprehensive evaluation can prevent common pitfalls when comparing pruning methods.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Single-cell {RNA} sequencing ({scRNA}-seq) is a powerful tool to profile the transcriptomes of a large number of individual cells at a high resolution. These data usually contain measurements of gene expression for many genes in thousands or tens of thousands of cells, though some datasets now reach the million-cell mark. Projecting high-dimensional {scRNA}-seq data into a low dimensional space aids downstream analysis and data visualization. Many recent preprints accomplish this using variational autoencoders ({VAE}), generative models that learn underlying structure of data by compress it into a constrained, low dimensional space. The low dimensional spaces generated by {VAEs} have revealed complex patterns and novel biological signals from large-scale gene expression data and drug response predictions. Here, we evaluate a simple {VAE} approach for gene expression data, Tybalt, by training and measuring its performance on sets of simulated {scRNA}-seq data. We find a number of counter-intuitive performance features: i.e., deeper neural networks can struggle when datasets contain more observations under some parameter configurations. We show that these methods are highly sensitive to parameter tuning: when tuned, the performance of the Tybalt model, which was not optimized for {scRNA}-seq data, outperforms other popular dimension reduction approaches – {PCA}, {ZIFA}, {UMAP} and t-{SNE}. On the other hand, without tuning performance can also be remarkably poor on the same data. Our results should discourage authors and reviewers from relying on self-reported performance comparisons to evaluate the relative value of contributions in this area at this time. Instead, we recommend that attempts to compare or benchmark autoencoder methods for {scRNA}-seq data be performed by disinterested third parties or by methods developers only on unseen benchmark data that are provided to all participants simultaneously because the potential for performance differences due to unequal parameter tuning is so high.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The paradigm problem considered is that of testing a series of messages one-by-one for membership in a given set of messages. Two new hashcoding methods are examined and compared with a particular conventional hash-coding method. The computational factors considered are the size of the hash area (space), the time required to identify a message as a nonmember of the given set (reject time), and an allowable error frequency. The new methods are intended to reduce the amount of space required to contain the hash-coded information from that associated with conventional methods. The reduction in space is accomplished by exploiting the possibility that a small fraction of errors of commission may be tolerable in some applications, in particular, applications in which a large amount of data is involved and a core resident hash area is consequently not feasible using conventional methods. In such applications, it is envisaged that overall performance could be improved by using a smaller core resident hash area in conjunction with the new methods and, when necessary, by using some secondary and perhaps time-consuming test to "catch" the small fraction of errors associated with the new methods. An example is discussed which illustrates possible areas of application for the new methods. Analysis of the paradigm problem demonstrates that allowing a small number of test messages to be falsely identified as members of the given set will permit a much smaller hash area to be used without increasing reject time.},

	abstract = {Metagenomics is the study of the genomic content of a sample of organisms obtained from a common habitat using targeted or random sequencing. Goals include understanding the extent and role of microbial diversity. The taxonomical content of such a sample is usually estimated by comparison against sequence databases of known sequences. Most published studies use the analysis of paired-end reads, complete sequences of environmental fosmid and {BAC} clones, or environmental assemblies. Emerging sequencing-by-synthesis technologies with very high throughput are paving the way to low-cost random “shotgun” approaches. This paper introduces {MEGAN}, a new computer program that allows laptop analysis of large metagenomic data sets. In a preprocessing step, the set of {DNA} sequences is compared against databases of known sequences using {BLAST} or another comparison tool. {MEGAN} is then used to compute and explore the taxonomical content of the data set, employing the {NCBI} taxonomy to summarize and order the results. A simple lowest common ancestor algorithm assigns reads to taxa such that the taxonomical level of the assigned taxon reflects the level of conservation of the sequence. The software allows large data sets to be dissected without the need for assembly or the targeting of specific phylogenetic markers. It provides graphical and statistical output for comparing different data sets. The approach is applied to several data sets, including the Sargasso Sea data set, a recently published metagenomic data set sampled from a mammoth bone, and several complete microbial genomes. Also, simulations that evaluate the performance of the approach for different read lengths are presented.},

	abstract = {There is increasing interest in employing shotgun sequencing, rather than amplicon sequencing, to analyze microbiome samples. Typical projects may involve hundreds of samples and billions of sequencing reads. The comparison of such samples against a protein reference database generates billions of alignments and the analysis of such data is computationally challenging. To address this, we have substantially rewritten and extended our widely-used microbiome analysis tool {MEGAN} so as to facilitate the interactive analysis of the taxonomic and functional content of very large microbiome datasets. Other new features include a functional classifier called {InterPro}2GO, gene-centric read assembly, principal coordinate analysis of taxonomy and function, and support for metadata. The new program is called {MEGAN} Community Edition ({CE}) and is open source. By integrating {MEGAN} {CE} with our high-throughput {DNA}-to-protein alignment tool {DIAMOND} and by providing a new program {MeganServer} that allows access to metagenome analysis files hosted on a server, we provide a straightforward, yet powerful and complete pipeline for the analysis of metagenome shotgun sequences. We illustrate how to perform a full-scale computational analysis of a metagenomic sequencing project, involving 12 samples and 800 million reads, in less than three days on a single server.

	abstract = {{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Abstract{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Identifying and quantifying the microbial composition of a complex biological or environmental sample is one of the primary challenges in microbiology. Many software tools have been developed to classify metagenomic sequencing reads originating from a mixture of bacterial or viral genomes, and to estimate the microbial abundance profile of the mixture. Unfortunately the accuracy of these tools significantly degrade in the presence of large portions of shared content among the genomes in the mixture or the genomic database in use. Here we introduce {CAMMiQ}, a novel combinatorial solution to the microbial identification and abundance estimation problem, which improves all available tools with respect to the number of correctly classified reads (i.e., specificity) by an order of magnitude and resolves possible mixtures of similar genomes, possibly at the strain level. The key contribution of {CAMMiQ} is its use of arbitrary length, doubly-unique substrings, i.e. substrings that appear in exactly two genomes in the input database, instead of fixed-length, unique substrings. In order to resolve the ambiguity in the genomic origin of doubly-unique substrings, {CAMMiQ} employs a combinatorial optimization formulation, which can be solved surprisingly quickly. {CAMMiQ}’s index consists of a sparsified subset of the shortest unique and doubly-unique substrings of each genome in the database, within a user specified length range and as such it is fairly compact. In short, {CAMMiQ} offers more accurate genomic identification and abundance estimation than the best known \textit{k}-mer based and marker gene based alternatives through the use of comparable computational resources.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Availability{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}https://github.com/algo-cancer/{CAMMiQ}{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Centrifuge requires a relatively small index (4.2 {GB} for 4078 bacterial and 200 archaeal genomes) and classifies sequences at very high speed, allowing it to process the millions of reads from a typical high-throughput {DNA} sequencing run within a few minutes. Together, these advances enable timely and accurate analysis of large metagenomics data sets on conventional desktop computers. Because of its space-optimized indexing schemes, Centrifuge also makes it possible to index the entire {NCBI} nonredundant nucleotide sequence database (a total of 109 billion bases) with an index size of 69 {GB}, in contrast to k-mer-based indexing schemes, which require far more extensive space.},

          Computational methods are key in microbiome research, and obtaining a quantitative and unbiased performance estimate is important for method developers and applied researchers. For meaningful comparisons between methods, to identify best practices, common use cases, and to reduce overhead in benchmarking, it is necessary to have standardized data sets, procedures, and metrics for evaluation. In this tutorial, we describe emerging standards in computational metaomics benchmarking derived and agreed upon by a larger community of researchers. Specifically, we outline recent efforts by the Critical Assessment of Metagenome Interpretation ({CAMI}) initiative, which supplies method developers and applied researchers with exhaustive quantitative data about software performance in realistic scenarios and organizes community-driven benchmarking challenges. We explain the most relevant evaluation metrics to assess metagenome assembly, binning, and profiling results, and provide step-by-step instructions on how to generate them. The instructions use simulated mouse gut metagenome data released in preparation for the second round of {CAMI} challenges and showcase the use of a repository of tool results for {CAMI} data sets. This tutorial will serve as a reference to the community and facilitate informative and reproducible benchmarking in microbiome research.},

It involves a wide range of mathematical methods, from probabilistic models of combinatorics to cluster analysis and pattern recognition techniques. The successful advance of rapid sequencing methods and fast and precise metagenome analysis will increase the diagnostic value of healthy or pathological human metagenomes. The article presents the theoretical foundations of the algorithm for calculating the number of different genomes in the medium under study. The approach is based on analysis of the compositional spectra of subsequently sequenced samples of the medium. Its essential feature is using random fluctuations in the bacteria number in different samples of the same metagenome. The possibility of effective implementation of the algorithm in the presence of data errors is also discussed. In the work, the algorithm of a metagenome evaluation is described, including the estimation of the genome number and the identification of the genomes with known compositional spectra. It should be emphasized that evaluating the genome number in a metagenome can be always helpful, regardless of the metagenome separation techniques, such as clustering the sequencing results or marker analysis.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Modern {DNA} sequencing technology produces large volumes of genome strings for various biological and medical applications. To mitigate the space overhead required for storing these genome data, previous research has developed compression schemes to save storage resources and to improve the locality for bioinformatics applications. These approaches, however, typically need significant additional processing to support efficient genome string search, an important step for downstream applications in a bioinformatics pipeline. In this paper, we propose to store raw {DNA} sequence data in a compressed but searchable format, enabling efficient string lookups using database indexes. To build this format, we partition genome strings by computing hash-based minimizers to group overlapping strings together. We carefully optimize our hash function to avoid large buckets caused by repetitive sequences. These buckets are then effectively compressed using local constructed references, and an index is built upon them to guide exact match lookups. Both data compression and string lookups exploit the enhanced locality as a result of the partitioning. We implement storage and search functions over the storage format as a multithreaded library, and perform extensive experiments on real genome sequencing data. The results show that our approach efficiently executes genome string lookups over highly compressed raw read data.},

Here, using random shotgun sequencing of {DNA} from a natural acidophilic biofilm, we report reconstruction of near-complete genomes of Leptospirillum group {II} and Ferroplasma type {II}, and partial recovery of three other genomes. This was possible because the biofilm was dominated by a small number of species populations and the frequency of genomic rearrangements and gene insertions or deletions was relatively low. Because each sequence read came from a different individual, we could determine that single-nucleotide polymorphisms are the predominant form of heterogeneity at the strain level. The Leptospirillum group {II} genome had remarkably few nucleotide polymorphisms, despite the existence of low-abundance variants. The Ferroplasma type {II} genome seems to be a composite from three ancestral strains that have undergone homologous recombination to form a large population of mosaic genomes. Analysis of the gene complement for each organism revealed the pathways for carbon and nitrogen fixation and energy generation, and provided insights into survival strategies in an extreme environment.},

Most of the methods currently available focus on the classification of reads using a set of reference genomes and their k-mers. While in terms of precision these methods have reached percentages of correctness close to perfection, in terms of recall (the actual number of classified reads) the performances fall at around 50\%. One of the reasons is the fact that the sequences in a sample can be very different from the corresponding reference genome, e.g. viral genomes are highly mutated. To address this issue, in this paper we study the problem of metagenomic reads classification by improving the reference k-mers library with novel discriminative k-mers from the input sequencing reads. We evaluated the performance in different conditions against several other tools and the results showed an improved F-measure, especially when close reference genomes are not available.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Availability{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}https://github.com/davide92/K2Mem.git{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

To address the ongoing pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 and expand the known sequence diversity of viruses, we aligned pangenomes for coronaviruses ({CoV}) and other viral families to 5.6 petabases of public sequencing data from 3.8 million biologically diverse samples. To implement this strategy, we developed a cloud computing architecture, `Serratus`, tailored for ultra-high throughput sequence alignment at the petabase scale. From this search, we identified and assembled thousands of {CoV} and {CoV}-like genomes and genome fragments ranging from known strains to putatively novel genera. We generalise this strategy to other viral families, identifying several novel deltaviruses and huge bacteriophages. To catalyse a new era of viral discovery we made millions of viral alignments and family identifications freely available to the research community (https://serratus.io). Expanding the known diversity and zoonotic reservoirs of {CoV} and other emerging pathogens can accelerate vaccine and therapeutic developments for the current pandemic, and help us anticipate and mitigate future ones.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We present a new construction, the semidirect product of op-based {CRDTs}, which combines the operations of two {CRDTs} into one while handling conflicts between their concurrent operations in a uniform way. We demonstrate the construction's utility by using it to construct novel {CRDTs}, as well as decomposing several existing {CRDTs} as semidirect products of simpler {CRDTs}. Although it reproduces common {CRDT} semantics, the semidirect product can be viewed as a restricted kind of operational transformation, thus forming a bridge between these two opposing techniques for constructing replicated data types.},

	abstract = {Generalised dissimilarity modelling ({GDM}) applies pairwise beta diversity as a measure of species turnover with the purpose of explaining changes in species composition under changing environments or along environmental gradients. Beta diversity only captures turnover across pairs of sites and, therefore, disproportionately represents turnover in rare species across communities. By contrast, zeta diversity, the average number of shared species across multiple sites, captures the full spectrum of rare, intermediate and widespread species as they contribute differently to compositional turnover. We show how integrating zeta diversity into {GDMs} (which we term multi-site generalised dissimilarity modelling, {MS}-{GDM}), provides a more information rich approach to modelling how communities respond to environmental variation and change. We demonstrate the value of including zeta diversity in biodiversity assessment and modelling using {BirdLife} Australia Atlas data. Zeta diversity values for different numbers of sites (the order of zeta) are regressed against environmental differences and distance using two kinds of regressions: shape constrained additive models and a combination of I-splines and generalised linear models. Applying {MS}-{GDM} to different orders of zeta revealed shifts in the importance of environmental variables in explaining species turnover, varying with the order of zeta and thus with the level of co-occurrence of the species and, by extension, their commonness and rarity. In particular, precipitation gradients emerged as drivers in the turnover of rare species, whereas temperature gradients were more important drivers of turnover in widespread species. Appreciation of the factors that drive compositional turnover across multiple sites is necessary for accommodating the full spectrum of compositional turnover across rare to common species. This extends beyond understanding drivers for pairwise beta diversity only. {MS}-{GDM} provides a valuable addition to the toolkit of {GDM}, with further potential for survey gap analysis and prediction of species composition in unsampled sites.},

	abstract = {Bacteria have been inferred to exhibit relatively weak biogeographic patterns. To what extent such findings reflect true biological phenomena or methodological artifacts remains unclear. Here, we addressed this question by analyzing the turnover of soil bacterial communities from three data sets. We applied three methodological innovations: (i) design of a hierarchical sampling scheme to disentangle environmental from spatial factors driving turnover; (ii) resolution of 16S {rRNA} gene amplicon sequence variants to enable higher-resolution community profiling; and (iii) application of the new metric zeta diversity to analyze multisite turnover and drivers. At fine taxonomic resolution, rapid compositional turnover was observed across multiple spatial scales. Turnover was overwhelmingly driven by deterministic processes and influenced by the rare biosphere. The communities also exhibited strong distance decay patterns and taxon-area relationships, with z values within the interquartile range reported for macroorganisms. These biogeographical patterns were weakened upon applying two standard approaches to process community sequencing data: clustering sequences at 97\% identity threshold and/or filtering the rare biosphere (sequences lower than 0.05\% relative abundance). Comparable findings were made across local, regional, and global data sets and when using shotgun metagenomic markers. Altogether, these findings suggest that bacteria exhibit strong biogeographic patterns, but these signals can be obscured by methodological limitations. We advocate various innovations, including using zeta diversity, to advance the study of microbial biogeography.
{IMPORTANCE} It is commonly thought that bacterial distributions show lower spatial variation than for multicellular organisms. In this article, we present evidence that these inferences are artifacts caused by methodological limitations. Through leveraging innovations in sampling design, sequence processing, and diversity analysis, we provide multifaceted evidence that bacterial communities in fact exhibit strong distribution patterns. This is driven by selection due to factors such as local soil characteristics. Altogether, these findings suggest that the processes underpinning diversity patterns are more unified across all domains of life than previously thought, which has broad implications for the understanding and management of soil biodiversity.},
