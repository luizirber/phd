abstract: |
  Biology as a field is being transformed by the increasing availability of data, especially genomic sequencing data.
  Computational methods that can adapt and take advantage from this data deluge are essential
  for exploring and providing insights for new hypothesis,
  helping to unveil the biological processes that expensive or even impossible to study before.

  This dissertation introduces data structures and approaches for scaling data
  analysis to hundreds of thousands of datasets using _Scaled MinHash_ sketches,
  a reduced space representation of the original datasets that can lower computational
  requirements for similarity and containment estimation;
  _MHBT_ and _LCA_ indices,
  structures for indexing and searching large collections of _Scaled MinHash_ sketches;
  `gather`, a new top-down approach for decomposing datasets into a collection of
  reference components that can be implemented efficiently with _Scaled MinHash_
  sketches and _MHBT_ and _LCA_ indices;
  `wort`,
  a distributed system for large scale sketch computation across heterogeneous systems,
  from laptops to academic clusters and cloud instances,
  including prototypes for containment searches across millions of datasets;
  as well as explorations on how to facilitate sharing and increase the
  resilience of sketches collections built from public genomic data.
